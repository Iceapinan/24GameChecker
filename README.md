### What is 24 Game ?
The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers
so that the end result is 24. For example, for the card with the numbers 4, 7, 8, 8, a possible solution is (7-(8/8))*4 = 24

### How it works:
- Input four digits that you want to solve = 24
- Tap "Go"

##### This is my first iOS App created when I was in Grade 8 on 09/06/2013.
##### Update 28/06/2017 : 24GameChecker supports from iOS 9 to iOS 11 devices.
